<h1>About Me</h1>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Artist & Musician:</h3><br/>I have always had a love for music and art from a very young age. <br/> My parents are both musicians with my mum being a classical guitarist and piano teacher, and my dad who was a DJ. 
    <br/>My life has naturally revolved around rummaging through my dad's old vinyl collection of music spanning genre's like Soul, R&B, Acoustic, Rock and loads more.</li>
    <li><h3>Surfing:</h3> Another big love of mine. Traveling around the world to find all the best surf spots it's always been a great way to have fun and relax.<br/>
    Usually surfing around Cornwall which is where I live and occasional trips to the south of France.</li>
    <li><h3>Coding</h3> I started coding mid way through last year and it has sparked such a great love for creating and really embellishing my skills. I am very excited for developing my skills to become an even more proficient coder in the future</li>
